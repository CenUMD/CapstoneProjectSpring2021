The original data file can be found on Kaggle, http://www.kaggle.com/omercolakoglu/turkish-market-sales-dataset-with-9000items

Github has a 25 MB per file limit per upload. The wrangled data is over 50 MB, too big to upload in one-shot. The three .csv files are parts of the one file for the wrangled data.

The column "Transaction Hour" in the wrangled data is derived by extracting the hour portion of the "Start Date" column.

The "Category Name1" and "Gender" Columns are translated from the original Turkish.

The SQL scripts using analytic functions to rank and segment the data set are in the four .sql files.
